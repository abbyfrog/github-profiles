# GitHub Profiles

GitHub Profiles is an application that allows you to search for a GitHub profile by its username and meets the requirements of the GitHub Profiles Project here: https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/GitHub-Profiles.md.

To use the application, open the [Netlify link](https://master--leafy-bavarois-0c0d31.netlify.app/), 
type in the username, and hit enter or click on the search button (magnifying glass).

## Profile information

The information shown for the GitHub profile is:
* Username
* Avatar
* Number of followers
* Number of (public) repositories
* Top four (public) repositories (ranked by number of forks and stars)

## Dark mode

You can change from light to dark mode by clicking the button on the top-right of
the screen. This will be saved so that next time you open the page on the browser, your
colour mode preference will be loaded.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
